# Simulated annealing using Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm to solve Traveling Salesman Problem
This code implements Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to find the closest path between 20 cities given in '20cities.dat'. In the beginning, distance matrix is built to
easily acquire distances between cities across the run. The initial temperature is 7000 K, and it is lowered by 20% across all steps of Monte Carlo simulation. The code also finds and returns the lowest distance which is often different than the final one given by the simulation.
